# Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Based Satellite Communication

This project explores **satellite communication optimization** using **Line-of-Sight (LOS)** paths and **Reconfigurable Refractive Surfaces (RRS)** to minimize the number of satellite hops required to connect two Earth-based locations.  
It demonstrates how incorporating RRS nodes in orbital space improves connectivity, reduces delays, and enhances efficiency compared to pure LOS-based communication.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
- Traditional satellite communication relies only on **direct LOS**, often leading to inefficient routing.  
- This project introduces **RRS nodes** (virtual "mirrors" in space) that redirect signals when direct LOS is unavailable.  
- A **Python-based simulation** evaluates both LOS-only and RRS-assisted paths.

---

## ðŸ›  Features
- Convert geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude) to 3D Cartesian space.
- Generate **satellite constellations** in configurable orbits (planes Ã— satellites per plane).
- Insert **RRS nodes** at random orbital offsets to simulate refractive surfaces.
- Implement **LOS checking** between Earth points and satellites.
- Use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the minimum-hop path between satellites.
- Compare performance **with vs. without RRS**.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- LOS-only model often requires longer paths and more satellites.
- RRS-assisted model reduces satellite hops, improving efficiency and reliability.
- Signal quality (measured via âˆ‘ 1/âˆšd) generally improves with RRS.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Work
- Implement smarter RRS placement strategies.
- Explore dynamic, programmable metasurfaces for real-time adaptation.
- Optimize pathfinding with A* or heuristic algorithms for scalability.
